Time complexity analysis:

Insert 0(n) with n is the length of a word
Find 0(n) with n is the length of a prefix
Suffixes 0(mn) with n is the length of a prefix and m (worst case) is the height of the trie

Space complexity analysis:

O(n) with n is the number of all distinct characters in the collections of words
